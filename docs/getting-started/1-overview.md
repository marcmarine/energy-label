# Overview

The **Energy Label** is a JavaScript/TypeScript library that helps you create energy labels in SVG format for products sold in the European Union (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º) and Great Britain (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§).

These labels are legally required for many products. While some governments provide APIs (like the UKâ€™s Energy Label API) or offer static assets for download, this library provides a more flexible approach. It includes extra features, runs directly in your application, and can be extended or improved by the developer community.

## Why use this library?

Here are some reasons why this library might be a better fit for your project:

- **No external API needed** â€“ works fully offline, in the browser or in Node.js.

- **Easy to customize** â€“ labels are SVG, so you can change their size, colors, or layout if needed.

- **Fast and lightweight** â€“ no need to wait for network requests.

- **Simple to integrate** â€“ works well in any JavaScript or TypeScript project.

- **Supports multiple regions** â€“ creates labels for both EU and GB formats.

If youâ€™re building an online store, a product management tool, or just need to generate labels in bulk, this library makes it easy to create accurate, standards-compliant energy labels without additional infrastructure.

## Getting started

Check the [installation steps](./2-installation.md) and the guides for [Node.js](./3-quick-start.md), the [browser](./3-quick-start.md), or [React](../guides/react.md) to integrate labels into your project.
